Welcome to the repository for my personal website, built with Next.js! This site serves as a portfolio and a way for recruiters and managers to explore my work and coding style.

## Overview

This website was initially bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app). It has been customized with several features, including:

- Tailwind CSS
- `next-intl`

## Features

- **Next.js**: The site is built using the powerful Next.js framework, which allows for server-side rendering, static site generation, and optimized performance.
- **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
- **Multilingual Setup**: Using `next-intl`, the content is available in both English and Portuguese. This makes the site accessible to a wider audience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: The best utility-first CSS framework is used to style the site. This allows for rapid development and easy customization.
- **FontAwesome**: A selection of FontAwesome icons are used across the site to enhance the UI.
