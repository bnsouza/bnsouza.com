    "p1": "I’m from São Paulo, Brazil, and my relationship with computers started early, at home. My father was a programmer, and when I was a kid, I would watch him work with COBOL on an old 386, using 5 and 3-inch floppy disks. Sometimes, I’d even remind him to add the periods in the code! At 13, I stayed home sick for a week, and started learning to program and soon began helping him for real.",
    "p2": "It was around that time that I witnessed the birth of the internet. I discovered Netscape, Linux, FrontPage, Dreamweaver, and Flash! Everything was changing fast, and as a curious teenager, I dove into ASP and PHP, leaving COBOL behind. From that point on, I never stopped. I saw jQuery rise, watched Flash shine and then be abandoned by Steve Jobs, and I followed the launch of the iPhone. PHP has also had its ups and downs, but it made a strong comeback (Server Components?!). I’ve explored various technologies, bet on Angular and lost, but today I’m a fan of React. I tried to launch a startup that didn’t work out, but I developed another service that’s been running for 12 years, and I’m still learning and evolving every day.",
    "p3": "With all this experience, I’ve acquired skills that are rare nowadays. Wherever I am, I know I can contribute because I’ve always adapted well to changes — both in my career and in life. After so many years of improvement, I’ve realized that my greatest strength is excelling at whatever I set my mind to. So, what will we create together?"
